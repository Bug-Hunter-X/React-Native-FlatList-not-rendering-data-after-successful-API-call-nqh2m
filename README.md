# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component fails to render data after a successful API call.  The problem stems from how asynchronous operations and state updates interact within the component's lifecycle.

## Problem Description

The `MyComponent` fetches data from a remote API. The API call is successful, and the data is correctly received and stored in the component's state. However, the `FlatList` component remains empty, indicating that it's not reflecting the updated state.

## Solution

The solution addresses the timing of state updates and data rendering.  A potential cause is that the state update happens after the component renders. The solution ensures the FlatList receives the correct updated state and triggers a re-render.
